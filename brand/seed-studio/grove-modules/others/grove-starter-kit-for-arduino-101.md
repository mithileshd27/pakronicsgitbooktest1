# Grove Starter kit for Arduino 101

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Starter_kit_for_Arduino_101/raw/master/img/Grove_Starter_kit_for_Arduino_101product_view_1024_s.jpg)

Grove system is designed to connect a processor to the real world through different transducers \(such as sensors and motors\), expansion boards and Grove wires which look like a ribbon cable. With Grove system, you will not bother to handle excessive and complicated connections as you used to do. No soldering tool, breadboard and jumper wire were required. You just need to plug plenty of transducers to development board with base shield expansion boards and Grove cables. Grove system is very helpful for accelerate your project development process, especially for a novice.

## Getting Started

### Fundamentals with Arduino

You need to know some essential knowledge if it is the first time that you get involved with Arduino. We have prepared some documentations for you to start with Arduino quickly and effectively. You can visit [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Foundations).

### Arduino Sketches \(basic example for each module\)

After you have gotten an LED blinking \(for Windows user, you can find it at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows), you can find other versions for Mac OS and Linux variants at [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) \), you still need to get familiar with Seeedstudio Grove system at [http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove\_System](/Grove_System). And now, you can do some more practical quizzes which are specialized designed for this kit. Download the sketches of quizzes at [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook\_Starter\_Kit\_for\_Arduino](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Sketchbook_Starter_Kit_for_Arduino).
