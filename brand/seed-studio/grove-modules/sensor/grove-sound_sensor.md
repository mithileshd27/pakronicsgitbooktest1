# Grove Sound Sensor

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove_Sound_Sensor/master/images/page.jpg)

Grove - Sound Sensor can detect the sound intensity of the environment. The main component of the module is a simple microphone, which is based on the LM386 amplifier and an electret microphone. This module's output is analog and can be easily sampled and tested by a Seeeduino.

## Features

* Easy to use
* Provides analog output signal
* Easily integrates with Logic modules on the input side of Grove circuits
* [Grove System](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove_System/)

!!!Warning This sound sensor is used to detect whether there's sound surround or not, please don't use the module to collect sound signal. For example, you can use it to make a sound control lamp, but not as a recording device.

## Specifications

| Item | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Operating Voltage Range | 3.3/5 V |
| Operating Current\(Vcc=5V\) | 4~5 mA |
| Voltage Gain\(V=6V, f=1kHz\) | 26 dB |
| Microphone sensitivity\(1kHz\) | 52-48 dB |
| Microphone Impedance | 2.2k Ohm |
| Microphone Frequency | 16-20 kHz |
| Microphone S/N Radio | 54 dB |

## Platforms Supported

## Getting Started

!!!Note This chapter is based on Win10 and Arduino IDE 1.6.9

This an easy-to-use module, what you need to do is to connect the signal pin \(the YELLOW pin of Grove cable\) to the ADC input of your controller. If there's no internal ADC in your controller, [Grove - I2C ADC](http://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-ADC-p-1580.html) is recommended.

Here we will show you how this Grove - Sound Sensor works via a simple demo. First of all, you need to prepare the below stuffs:

**Connection**

Thanks to the benefit of Grove series modules, you don't need to make soldering or bread board, what you need to do is to connect the modules to the right port of Base Shield. For this demo, we only need one Grove module.

* Grove - Sound Sensor is an analog input module, we connect it to **A0** at this demo

**Upload the code to Arduino**

Copy the below code to Arduino IDE.

```text
// test code for Grove - Sound Sensor
// loovee @ 2016-8-30

const int pinAdc = A0;

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(115200);
    //Serial.println("Grove - Sound Sensor Test...");
}

void loop()
{
    long sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<32; i++)
    {
        sum += analogRead(pinAdc);
    }

    sum >>= 5;

    Serial.println(sum);
    delay(10);
}
```

Then choose the right Board and COM port, and then click on the Upload button, this process take few seconds.

**Get Raw Data**

Here let's click on **Serial &gt; Plotter** to get the changing curve of the sensor. Please make a noise to view the change of the value.
