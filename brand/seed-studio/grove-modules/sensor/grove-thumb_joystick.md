# Grove Thumb Joystick

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Thumb_Joystick/master/img/Bgjoy1.jpg)

Grove - Thumb Joystick is a Grove compatible module which is very similar to the 'analog' joystick on PS2 \(PlayStation 2\) controllers. The X and Y axes are two ~10k potentiometers which control 2D movement by generating analog signals. The joystick also has a push button that could be used for special applications. When the module is in working mode, it will output two analog values, representing two directions. Compared to a normal joystick, its output values are restricted to a smaller range \(i.e. 200~800\), only when being pressed that the X value will be set to 1023 and the MCU can detect the action of pressing.

## Features

## Platforms Supported

## Usage

### With [Arduino](/Arduino)

The Grove - Thumb Joystick is an analog device that outputs analog signal ranging from 0 to 1023. That requires us to use the analog port of Arduino to take the readings.

1.Connect the module to the A0/A1 of [Grove - Base Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/grove-base-shield-p-754.html) by using the 4-pin grove cable.

2.Plug the Grove - Basic Shield into Arduino.

3.Connect Arduino to PC by using a USB cable. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Thumb_Joystick/master/img/Grove-Thumb_Joystick.jpg)

4.Copy and paste code below to a new Arduino sketch.

```text
/*
  Thumb Joystick demo v1.0
  by:http://www.seeedstudio.com
  connect the module to A0&A1 for using;
*/

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
    int sensorValue1 = analogRead(A0);
    int sensorValue2 = analogRead(A1);

    Serial.print("The X and Y coordinate is:");
    Serial.print(sensorValue1, DEC);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.println(sensorValue2, DEC);
    Serial.println(" ");
    delay(200);
}
```

5.You can check the values of the output analog signals by opening the Serial Monitor.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Thumb_Joystick/master/img/Grove-Thumd_Joystick_Result.jpg)

The output value from the analog port of Arduino can be converted to the corresponding resistance by using the formula:R=\(float\)\(1023-sensorValue\)\*10/sensorValue.

### With Raspberry Pi

1.You should have got a raspberry pi and a grovepi or grovepi+.

2.You should have completed configuring the development environment, otherwise please follow [here](/GrovePiPlus).

3.Connection

* Plug the sensor to grovepi socket A0 by using a grove cable.

  4.Navigate to the demos' directory:

  ```text
  cd yourpath/GrovePi/Software/Python/
  ```

* To see the code

  ```text
  nano grove_thumb_joystick.py   # "Ctrl+x" to exit #
  ```

  ```text
  import time
  import grovepi

  # Connect the Grove Thumb Joystick to analog port A0

  # GrovePi Port A0 uses Arduino pins 0 and 1
  # GrovePi Port A1 uses Arduino pins 1 and 2
  # Don't plug anything into port A1 that uses pin 1
  # Most Grove sensors only use 3 of their 4 pins, which is why the GrovePi shares Arduino pins between adjacent ports
  # If the sensor has a pin definition SIG,NC,VCC,GND, the second (white) pin is not connected to anything

  # If you wish to connect two joysticks, use ports A0 and A2 (skip A1)

  # Uses two pins - one for the X axis and one for the Y axis
  # This configuration means you are using port A0
  xPin = 0
  yPin = 1
  grovepi.pinMode(xPin,"INPUT")
  grovepi.pinMode(yPin,"INPUT")

  # The Grove Thumb Joystick is an analog device that outputs analog signal ranging from 0 to 1023
  # The X and Y axes are two ~10k potentiometers and a momentary push button which shorts the x axis

  # My joystick produces slightly different results to the specifications found on the url above
  # I've listed both here:

  # Specifications
  #     Min  Typ  Max  Click
  #  X  206  516  798  1023
  #  Y  203  507  797

  # My Joystick
  #     Min  Typ  Max  Click
  #  X  253  513  766  1020-1023
  #  Y  250  505  769
  while True:
      try:
          # Get X/Y coordinates
          x = grovepi.analogRead(xPin)
          y = grovepi.analogRead(yPin)

          # Calculate X/Y resistance
          Rx = (float)(1023 - x) * 10 / x
          Ry = (float)(1023 - y) * 10 / y

          # Was a click detected on the X axis?
          click = 1 if x >= 1020 else 0

          print "x =", x, " y =", y, " Rx =", Rx, " Ry =", Ry, " click =", click
          time.sleep(.5)

      except IOError:
          print "Error"
  ```

5.Run the demo.

```text
    sudo python grove_thumb_joystick.py
```
