### Download sample code

1.You can [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-Mini_Track_Ball/master/res/Grove-Mini_Track_ball_test.zip) the sample code.

2.Decompress the downloaded ZIP file.

3.Open the file **Grove\_-\_Mini\_Track\_ball\_test.ino**

4.Flash \(or upload\) your code into Seeeduino board. if uploading process is done, to open Serial Monitor window, Click **Serial Monitor** under menu **Tool**.

Note Make sure you have selected the right Board and Port under the Tool menu.

5.LED indicator under tracking ball will light on in different mode which will last around 50 seconds

6.After that you can rotate or "click" the track ball to get information of its trace.
