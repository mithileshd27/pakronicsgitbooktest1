# Grove IMU 9DOF v2.0

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-IMU_9DOF_v2.0/master/img/Grove-IMU_9DOF_v2.0.JPG)

Grove - IMU 9DOF v2.0 is an upgraded version of **Grove - IMU 9DOF v1.0** and it is a high performance 9-axis motion tracking module, which is based on MPU-9250. The MPU-9250 is an integrated 9-axis motion tracking device designed for the low power, low cost, and high performance requirements of consumer electronics equipment including smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors. MPU-9250 features three 16-bit ADC for digitizing the gyroscope outputs and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the accelerometer outputs and three 16-bit ADCs for digitizing the magnetometer outputs.

## Specifications

* I2C/SPI interface
* Auxiliary I2C
* Low Power Consumption
* 400kHz Fast Mode I2C for communicating with all registers
* Digital-output 3-Axis angular rate sensors \(gyroscopes\) with a user-programmable full-scale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000°/sec
* Digital-output 3-Axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and ±16g
* Digital-output 3-Axis accelerometer with a full scale measurement range is ±4800μT

## Platforms Supported

## Hardware Overview

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-IMU_9DOF_v2.0/master/img/Grove-IMU_9DOF_v2_inter.png)

① - Grove interface,connect to I2C

② - I2C or SPI select pad\(default is I2C\), if want to use SPI, disconnect this pad

③ - Address select pad, default connected b and c address is 0x68, if connect b and a address is 0x69, if want to use SPI, disconnect this pad to either side.

④ - SPI Interface

⑤ - Auxiliary I2C master serial data

⑥ - Auxiliary I2C master serial clock

⑦ - Interrupt digital output

## Usage

Based on library,we can display value of Accel&Gyro&Magnet on serial monitor. Now let's show how to use the module.

### Hardware Installation

Hardware installation is very easy, because there's an I2C Grove in Seeeduino, so what we need to do is connect it to I2C Grove via a Grove cable.

### Software Part

1. Download the [library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeedDocument/Grove-IMU_9DOF_v2.0/master/res/Grove_IMU_9DOF_9250.zip).
2. Unzip libraries into the libraries file of Arduino IDE by the path: ..\arduino-1.0.5\libraries.
3. Unzip IMU\_9D0F\_Demo file into the libraries file of Arduino IDE by the path: ..\arduino-1.0.5\libraries.
4. Open the code directly by the path: File -&gt; Example -&gt; Grove\_IMU\_9DOF\_9250
5. Upload the code. Note that you should select the correct board type and COM port.
6. You can see :

In static state，the z-Axis output value is about 0.98g，so you can refer to this to test if your sensor can work normally.

**Orientation of Axes**

The diagram below shows the orientation of the axes of sensitivity and the polarity of rotation.Note the pin 1 identifier \(•\) in the figure.
